  ## Introduction
  Working on the BoboBird.watch website and building an e-commerce solution for a company that cares for the planet was very rewarding and challenging at the same time. As there were a lot of different parts that needed to work together perfectly as a whole. 

  ### My Role
  I was tasked with all design related aspects of this project. From creating the company logo, to designing user/checkout flows, as well as partner dashboards, and UI/UX of specific features. 

  ### The Challenge
  Designing and building an e-commerce solution with extended functionality for partners and affiliates. 

  ### The Process
  As the only designer/design consultant, and with a blank slate, it was great being able to brainstorm and come up with ideas to build something that is easy to use without neglecting the user experience. 
  _
  My value proposition was to create an e-commerce website with WordPress and Woocommerce._


  Why was WordPress and Woocommerce the solution?
  – Most of the team members were familiar with WordPress

  – Available plugins made it possible to build this website without the help of a programmer

  – I was comfortable taking on this project because of the experience I have with WordPress

  ### Landing Pages
  One of the team’s mission is to partner and collaborate with other meaningful companies and non-profit organisations. They envisioned doing this by bundling partner products with their Wooden Wrist Watch and build marketing campaigns around that special offer. 

  I suggested that creating dedicated landing pages for every partnership would be most suitable in this case. In the example shown above (the image is scrollable) you see the Landing Page I designed for the partnership with One Tree Planted. Whenever a customer buys the watch through the dedicated partner landing page, 12 trees are planted on their behalf in the Amazon Rainforest.  

  It took a few redesigns and iterations to come up with a Landing Page template that allowed for easy customisation and content to be swapped out for different partner needs.
